# Introduction

This is my first repo, loot at me now:)
This repository contains a project smartly designed to help:
Beginners.-
Understand key concepts in C and Python programing.
Objetive.-
The goal is gradually build a program by completing small tasks:
basic maths, working whit numbers in different ways,
managing memory and files.
The first part focuses on C programng, where you'll write:
functions and test the provided main.c file.
The following part are similar tasks done using Python.
This course encourages small coding habits, like breaking down tasks..
into smaller parts and using Git hub to track your progress step by step.
